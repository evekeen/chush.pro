  This is an <strong>Items</strong> element, and it's basically just a grid for organizing items of various types. You can customize its <span class="demo-controls">appearance with a number of modifiers</span>, as well as assign it an optional <code>onload</code> or <code>onscroll</code> transition modifier (<a href="#reference-items">details</a>).
